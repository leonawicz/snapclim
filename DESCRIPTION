Title: What the Package Does (one line, title case)
Description: Provides access to curated collections of public climate data sets
    offered by Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
    'snapclim' interfaces with SNAP's Amazon Web Services cloud storage to retrieve specific climate data.
    Available data includes historical observations as well as historical and projected climate model outputs.
    Available climate variables include temperature and precipitation.
    Spatial coverage includes politically and ecologically defined aerial units as well as communites and other 
    point locations of interest across Alaska and western Canada.
    Depending on the specific climate data set, temporal resolution ranges from daily to decadal.
